## Live working version
I used this privately for a long time, now it is open to the public: https://xh4h.com/shorten

## What is "SimpleURLShortener"?
SimpleURLShortener is a lightweight and open sourced URL Shortener which aims to be easily deployed in any server running Express.

I was sick of full-of-ads shorteners and volatile shortened URLs, and since many more people are in the same situation, I decided to develop this project.

## How to install
1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/Xh4H/SimpleURLShortener/releases).
1. Open and edit `shortener_config.json` by filling the connection details to your DB.
1. run `npm install && npm run-script setup` to prepare the environment
1. run `node start` to start the service.

Service will be running in `ip/shorten`.
